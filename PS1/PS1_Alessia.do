**# QUESTION 1 

* (a)

use "jtrain2.dta", clear

*	Construct a balance table
ssc install balancetable, replace

help balancetable

* COMMENT ON HOW MANY VARIABLES ARE BALANCED OR NOT. IS THAT WHAT YOU EXPECTED? (TO DO)

/* (b) 
Regress re78 on train. Save the estimate and the standard error of the coefficient on train as scalars. Interpret the coefficient.
*/

scalar train_coef = _b[train]
scalar train_se = _se[train]

* WRITE HERE INTERPRETATION OF THE COEFFICIENT



/*(c) 
Construct a table by sequentially adding the output of the following regressions
to each column:
(1) re78 on train;
(2) re78 on train age educ black hisp;
(3) re78 on train age educ black hisp re74 re75;
Add rows to the table with the number of controls and treated in each regression.
Name it TABLE_2.
Are your results sensitive to the introduction of covariates?*/

/*(d) 
dfbeta is a statistic that measures how much the regression coefficient of a certain variable changes in standard deviations if the i-th observation is deleted.
Type help dfbeta and discover how to estimate this statistic after a regression.
Generate a variable named influence train storing the dfbetas of train of the last regression you did in point (c).
Redo the last regression you did in point (c) but removing the observations with the 3, 5, and 10 lowest and largest values in influence train. Are your results sensitive to in infuential observations?*/
