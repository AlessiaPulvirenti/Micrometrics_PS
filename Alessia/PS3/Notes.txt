Moreover, Gonzales 2021 identifies some threats to identification: 
--> [WRITE HERE THREATS TO IDENTIFICATION FROM THE ADDITIONAL RESULTS SECTION]
* it must be that that the phone providers do not select where to locate based on characteristics which can also affect the level of fraud in elections, such as education levels, urbanisation levels, population density. 

* In his "Additional Results" section, Gonzales (2021) provides evidence of the fact that selection into coverage is not a cause of concern for the one-dimensional RD design adopted. Another threat to identification is Mobile Coverage Spillovers and Spatial Displacement of Fraud. Coverage in one area can lead to positive spillovers in another area which is officially considered as "uncovered". In particular, and this emerges from our RD plot using the distance measure with proxied latitude, spillovers can result from a coverage boundary which is not sharp. This could be the case if polling centers in non-coverage areas (at the boundary of non-coverage areas) can still benefit from coverage from close areas. If this were to be the case, than non-coverage areas can have lower level of fraud because they benefitted from coverage from other areas. This could downward bias the one-dimensional estimates that Gonzales (2021) shows in Table 2 of page 18 of the paper. A proper fuzzy RDD design cannot be implemented by Gonzales because we are not sure if these polling centers acyally benefitted from some coverage from the neighbouring centers (in that case, they would be non-compliers but we cannot ascertain that).
