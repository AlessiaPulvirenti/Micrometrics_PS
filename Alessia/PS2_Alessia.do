/*
Y = /beta X + /epsilon		(1) - original model to be estimated - X is endogenous
X = /pie Z + /nu 			(2)	- First stage

Bound et al. (1995) analyse two cases under which the IV approach can lead to unconsistent estimates, with inconsistency that could be larger than that of the OLS estimator using and endogenous variable. 
One case is that of a weak instrument: when the instrument Z, used to get around the problem of endogeneity of the treatment variable X, is weakly correlated with the endogenous variable in question, this is likely to generate a large inconsistency in the IV estimates. In the case of an IV approach with no covariates, the authors prove this by showing that the ratio of the inconsistency of the IV estimator to the inconsistency of the OLS estimator is an expression that has at the denominator the correlation between X and Z, and at the numerator, the correlation between Z and the error term, and X and the error term. Therefore, if the instrument is only slightly endogenous (i.e., if the instrument Z has a very low correlation with the unboservable characteristics that affect Y in eq. (1)), this bias can be greatly amplified by low correlation between Z and X. In an IV setting where the first stage (and thus the second stage) include some covariates as in this case, Bound et al. prove that the ratio of the inconsistency of IV to inconsistency of OLS id negatively associated to the partial R-squared of the first stage, that is, the R-squared from the regression of x on z once the common exogenous variable have been partialled out from both X and Z.

In our case, since the partialled R-Squared for all three instruments is very low, if the quarter of birth proves to be even slightly endogenous to the unobserved characteristics that might affect health status, then the coefficient computed in the second stage could be biased. For example, if the quarter of birth is endogenous to the socio-economic status of individuals in the sample, then the IV coefficient could be upward biased. This could be a plausible explanation since our IV estimate is higher than the OLS estimate. Angrist and Krueger (1991, 1992 - a subsequent paper) provide many evidence to show that compulsory attendance laws are working to induce a correlation in educational attainment. However, if compulsory schooling law are not the ONLY channel through which quarter of birth and educational attainment are correlated (exclusion restriction), and quarter of birth is correlated in some way with health status, then our IV estimate can be strongly inconsistent, even more than than the OLS. Bound et al. 1995 provide some evidence of the correlation between birth seasonality and physical and mental health of individuals, listing some papers that prove that individuals born early in the years are more likely to be affected by schizofrenia, mental retardation, autism etc. 

The other problem discussed by Bound and coauthors when dealing with IVs is related to finite-sample bias. Assuming that the instrument Z is completely exogenous, the IV is a consistent estimator of /beta, but in finite samples, it is biased in the same direction of the OLS estimator. The magnitude of the bias depends negatively on the sample size, and negatively on the multiple correlation between the instruments and the endogenous explanatory variables.

Bound et al. (1995) suggest that to assess finite-sample bias, it is useful to examine the F-statistic from the First Stage. They claim that the bias of the instrumental variable (IV) relative to ordinary least squares (OLS) is inversely related to the F-statistic of the excluded instruments from the first stage. In our analysis, we obtained an F-statistic of 62. According to Bound et al. (1995), a close-to-1 F-statistic raises concerns about finite-sample bias. However, since our F-statistic is large, we can confidently state that finite-sample bias is not an issue in this case. Additionally, Staiger and Stock (1994) suggest that the bias of OLS relative to IV could be approximated by 1/F, where F is the F-statistic. Therefore, if the F-statistic is large, as in our case, the bias is likely to be very small.
