The case in which we would need to modify our RD design would be the one in which there are spillovers and spatial displacement of fraud (we could not label coverage boundary as "sharp" in this case) that lead to a downward bias of estimates presented in Gonzalez's Table 2. In the "Mobile Coverage Spillovers and Spatial Displacement of Fraud" part of the Additional Results section, Gonzalez introduces bands of 2km, 4km, 6km and 8km on the non-coverage side to estimate the likelihood of fraud in these non-overlapping regions. He found no statistically significant spikes nor drops in fraud measures in comparison to areas just outside the band, meaning that the coverage boundary "remains" sharp. For these reasons, we should not worry about our proxy leading to a bias in the estimates, provided that the absolute difference between true longitude and observed proxy is less than the length of the bands.
