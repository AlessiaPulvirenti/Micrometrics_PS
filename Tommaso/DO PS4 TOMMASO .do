*** The coefficient of interest is the one on PLACEBO_POST_INTENSITY, which is positive but has an associated p-value of 0.489, therefore it is insignificant. We are satisfied by this result which sustains our design. Indeed, there appears to be no effect in the pre-treatment years. Thus, it is unlikely that the previosuly estimated causal effect of interest is caused by Omitted Variable Bias, which would have been picked also up in this placebo test and disguised as a significant causal effect. Notice that year fixed effect (the dummy for 1990) have been excluded from the regression because of multicollinearity with PLACEBO_POST. ***
